# Donations Box

A simple scene that uses the `decentraland-crypto-utils` library to make a MANA payment when a player clicks on a donations box

The crypto Utils function makes it a lot simpler to perform blockchain functions. Sending MANA from one account to another just takes one line of code using this library.
