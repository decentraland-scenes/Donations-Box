# Donations Box

A simple scene that uses the `decentraland-crypto-utils` library to make a MANA payment when a player clicks on a donations box

The crypto Utils function makes it a lot simpler to perform blockchain functions. Sending MANA from one account to another just takes one line of code using this library.

**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command

```bash
npm i -g decentraland
```

For a more details, follow the steps in the [Installation guide](https://docs.decentraland.org/documentation/installation-guide/).

**Previewing the scene**

Once you've installed the CLI, download this example and navigate to its directory from your terminal or command prompt.

_from the scene directory:_

```
$:  dcl start
```

Any dependencies are installed and then the CLI will open the scene in a new browser tab automatically.

Paste the following to the end of the URL in the browser window:

```
&ENABLE_WEB3
```

For example, if the URL is `http://127.0.0.1:8000?position=0%2C0&SCENE_DEBUG_PANEL`, make it `http://127.0.0.1:8000?position=0%2C0&SCENE_DEBUG_PANEL&ENABLE_WEB3`
